        <div class="subheading mb-5">MathematicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently attending UC Riverside as a Mathematics Major with a concentration in Applied Mathematics. I graduate June of 2023. Relevant Coursework: Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Ordinary Differential Equations, Optimization, Game Theory, Set Theory, Intermediate Analysis. I am proficient in Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel. Bilingual in both English and Spanish. I have high verbal and communication skills and I enjoy critical thinking and problem solving.  As a Mathematics major, I hope to apply everything I have learned into a career. As a career I currently aspire to be an Actuary where I would analyze the financial costs of risk and uncertainty. I also find interest in working for a financial institution.    <br><br>

        I have vast experience as a tutor, having taught all grade level from Elementary Math to Middle School and Highschool Courses. This includes Trigonometry, Algebra 1 & 2, Geometry, Precalculus, Statistics, AP Calculus AB, and AP Calculus BC. I have also taught various Undergraduate University level courses such as Business Mathematics, Introduction to Calculus, Calculus, and Statistics. When I provide tutoring, it can either be in groups of three to five students or interactive one on one sessions, either through in person or remote sessions. I have been tutoring since 2018, first as a tutor for my High School and then tutoring freelance. I continue to tutor students to this day and have learned a lot about guiding students and how to create a curriculum that goes alongside their course and create study sessions that will be best suited the studentâ€™s needs.  <br><br>

        I enjoy spending my time hiking, working out, watching anime and spending time with my family. Working out has shaped me into a stronger individual as every time I go to the gym, I set new goals and always appreciate the effort that I am putting in. A major part of my life has been Taekwondo. I am a Second Degree Blackbelt and have been training since September of 2010. I have been both a student and an instructor. When I arrived at UC Riverside, I joined Taekwondo at UCR. I was able to connect with many like-minded students that came from various background and from many different places. As soon as my second year of college began, I then joined the club as an Instructor and Public Relations Officer. As an instructor directed classes of 20-40 students teaching Taekwondo, self-defense training, and exercises through in-person and online classes. Teaching beginner, intermediate, and experienced students kicking, sparring, forms, etc. I created workout plans and programs that would allow for a competitive and team-building environment. As a Public Relations Officer I created relationships and collaborated with school organizations/clubs to help promote events and fundraisers. I also assisted in managing events and programs and interacted with incoming freshman and transfer students to boost membership. I was able to increase club membership by promoting club through school events and social media. I hope that after learning about me you can get a better grasp of the type of person I am.
